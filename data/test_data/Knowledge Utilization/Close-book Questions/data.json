Due to the Earth's axial tilt, the Arctic Circle receives 24 hours of sunlight during the summer solstice and 24 hours of darkness during the winter solstice. This extreme variation in sunlight contributes to the formation of seasonal ice caps, which in turn affect global ocean circulation and climate.\n\nThe Arctic Ocean is home to unique ecosystems and species that have adapted to its harsh environment. Marine mammals such as polar bears, walruses, and several species of seals depend on the Arctic Ocean for their survival.\n\nDespite its inhospitable conditions, the Arctic Ocean has become a focal point for geopolitical and economic interests. The melting of the polar ice cap due to climate change has opened up new shipping routes and increased access to valuable natural resources, leading to competition among nations for control over these resources.\n\nAnswer the following questions:\n1.

It is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of other elements. Jupiter's atmosphere exhibits a wide range of colorful bands and storms, including the famous Great Red Spot, which is a large, long-lasting storm. The planet has a strong magnetic field due to its rapid rotation and its metallic hydrogen interior. Jupiter has an extensive system of rings and at least 79 known moons, the four largest of which are called the Galilean moons.\n\nQuestion: How does Jupiter's strong magnetic field form?\n\n(a) Due to its large size\n(b) Due to its rapid rotation and metallic hydrogen interior\n(c) Due to the Great Red Spot\n(d) Due to its extensive system of rings and moons\n\nAnswer:"
