There are 7 choices for the hundreds digit, 9 choices for the tens digit, and 9 choices for the units digit, giving us 7 * 9 * 9 = 567 numbers without any 6's. Next, let's count the numbers with exactly one 6. There are 2 positions for the 6 (tens and units), 7 choices for the hundreds digit, and 8 choices for the remaining digit, giving us 2 * 7 * 8 = 112 numbers. Now, subtract the total count without any 6's and with exactly one 6 from the total numbers from 1 to 800, which is 800. So, the answer is 800 - 567 - 112 = 121 numbers that contain the digit 6 at least twice."
