        "reference_answer": "\\begin{proof}\n\n    Let $\\left(X, d_X\\right)$ and $\\left(Y, d_Y\\right)$ be metric spaces; let $Y$ be complete. Let $A \\subset X$. It is also given that $f: A \\longrightarrow X$ is a uniformly continuous function. Then we have to show that $f$ can be uniquely extended to a continuous function $g: \\bar{A} \\longrightarrow Y$, and $g$ is uniformly coninuous.\n\nWe define the function $g$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\ng(x)= \\begin{cases}f(x) & \\text { if } x \\in A \\\\ \\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} f\\left(x_n\\right) & \\text { if } x \\in \\bar{A},\\end{cases}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $\\left\\{x_n\\right\\} \\subset A$ is some sequence in $A$ such that $\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} x_n=x$. Now we have to check that the above definition is well defined. We first note that since $\\left\\{x_n\\right\\} \\subset A$ is convergent in $X,\\left\\{x_n\\right\\}$ is Cauchy in $A$ and since $f$ is uniformly continuous on $A,\\left\\{f\\left(x_n\\right)\\right\\}$ is Cauchy in $Y$. Further, since $Y$ is complete $\\left\\{f\\left(x_n\\right)\\right\\}$ is convergent. So let us now consider two sequences $\\left\\{x_n\\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{y_n\\right\\}$ such that $\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} x_n=\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} y_n=x$. Then we need to prove that $\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} f\\left(x_n\\right)=\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} f\\left(y_n\\right)=f(x)$. Let\n\n$$\n\n\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} f\\left(x_n\\right)=a \\text { and } b=\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} f\\left(y_n\\right)\n\n$$\n\nNow since $f$ is uniformly continuous for any given $\\epsilon>0$ there exists $\\delta>0$ such that\n\n$$\n\nd_Y(f(x), f(y))<\\epsilon \\text { whenever } d_X(x, y)<\\delta \\text { and } x, y \\in A\n\n$$\n\nSo for this $\\delta>0$ there exists $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that\n\n$$\n\nd_X\\left(x_n, x\\right)<\\frac{\\delta}{2} \\text { and } d_X\\left(y_n, x\\right)<\\frac{\\delta}{2}, \\text { foe all } n \\geq N .\n\n$$\n\nTherefore, we have that for all $n \\geq N$,\n\n$$\n\nd_X\\left(x_n, y_n\\right)<\\delta\n\n$$\n\nThus the equation (1) yields us that\n\n$$\n\nd_Y\\left(f\\left(x_n\\right), f\\left(y_n\\right)\\right)<\\epsilon \\text { for all } n \\geq N .\n\n$$\n\nNow since $\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} f\\left(x_n\\right)=a$ and $b=\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} f\\left(y_n\\right)$, so for the above $\\epsilon>0$ we have a natural number $K \\geq N$ such that\n\n$$\n\n\\begin{gathered}\n\nd_Y\\left(f\\left(x_n\\right), a\\right)<\\epsilon \\text { for all } n \\geq K \\text { and } \\\\\n\nd_Y\\left(f\\left(y_n\\right), b\\right)<\\epsilon \\text { for all } n \\geq K .\n\n\\end{gathered}\n\n$$\n\nMoreover, since $K \\geq N$, from $(2)$ we get\n\n$$\n\nd_Y\\left(f\\left(x_n\\right), f\\left(y_n\\right)\\right)<\\epsilon \\text { for all } n \\geq K .\n\n$$\n\nNow we calculate the following, for $n \\geq K$,\n\n$$\n\n\\begin{array}{rlr}\n\nd_Y(a, b) & \\leq & d_Y\\left(a, f\\left(x_n\\right)\\right)+d_Y\\left(f\\left(x_n\\right), f\\left(y_n\\right)\\right)+d\\left(f\\left(y_n\\right), b\\right) \\\\\n\n& < & \\epsilon+\\epsilon+\\epsilon \\text { by }(3),(4) \\text { and }(5) \\\\\n\n& = & 3 \\epsilon\n\n\\end{array}\n\n$$\n\nwhere the first inequality holds because of triangular inequality. Since $\\epsilon>0$ is arbitrary the above calculation shows that $d_Y(a, b)=0$. Thus, the above definition is independent of the choice of the sequence $\\left\\{x_n\\right\\}$ and hence the map $g$ is well defined. Moreover, from the construction it follows that $g$ is continuous on $\\bar{A}$.\n\nMoreover, we observe that $g$ is unique extension of $f$ by the construction.\n\nSo it remains to show that $g$ is uniformly continuous. In order to that we take a Cauchy sequence $\\left\\{a_n\\right\\} \\subset \\bar{A}$. Then since $\\bar{A}$ is a closed set so the sequence $\\left\\{a_n\\right\\}$ is convergent and hence $\\left\\{g\\left(a_n\\right)\\right\\}$ is also a convergent sequence as $g$ is continuous on $\\bar{A}$. So $\\left\\{g\\left(a_n\\right)\\right\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $Y$. Since a function is uniformly continuous if and only if it sends Cauchy sequences to Cauchy sequences, we conclude that $g$ is uniformly continuous.\n\n\\end{proof}",

Prove that if the following two conditions hold then $R$ is a Principal Ideal Domain: (i) any two nonzero elements $a$ and $b$ in $R$ have a greatest common divisor which can be written in the form $r a+s b$ for some $r, s \\in R$, and (ii) if $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \\ldots$ are nonzero elements of $R$ such that $a_{i+1} \\mid a_{i}$ for all $i$, then there is a positive integer $N$ such that $a_{n}$ is a unit times $a_{N}$ for all $n \\geq N$."
