Which of the following is most helpful in explaining the phenomenon mentioned in the title, that is, the result of the throw is determined by certain factors, but it is difficult to predict? A.For a long time, tossing coins has been used as a typical example of random events. B.If you toss a coin of uneven quality, the result can always be accurately predicted. C.If the initial height of the coin toss remains stable, the result of the coin toss will be determined solely by the tossing force. D.Accurate prediction of coin tossing results requires accurate estimation of the initial height and impulse of coin tossing.",

If any of the following statements are true, can we best explain the seemingly contradictory phenomenon? A.With the reform of the economic system and the promotion of new urbanization, the PPP model has high hopes from all walks of life B.The PPP model is more complicated, and the local government \u2019s bargaining power and PPP expertise are not as good as those of investors. C.This year, the National Development and Reform Commission released 80 important projects to encourage social capital to participate in construction and operation through PPP and other means D.In order to prevent economic losses caused by local government defaults, investors try to transfer other interests to their own enterprises",

If any of the following statements are true, will it be most helpful to resolve the doubts above? A.The shark's teeth need to be replaced many times in its lifetime, but the shark's skeleton is not changed for life, only one skeleton. B.Compared to the skeletons of teeth or other vertebrates, shark cartilage skeletons are less likely to form fossils. C.The process of petrification of the shark skeleton is the same as the physical changes experienced by the petrification of the shark teeth. D.It is indeed confusing to find the skeleton fossil where the shark tooth fossil was found.",
