Each social media platform acts as a digital home for individuals, allowing people to express themselves through the global village.[9] A Review of General Semantics argues that media ecology and new media have expanded who has the ability to create and view media texts.[13] Since mass media began, it has called for the westernisation of the world. Without the mass media in effect, other countries may not have the knowledge of what the acquisitions of the other nations of the world constitute. Since most of the developing countries acquired the news and entertainment from developed nations like the U.S, the information received can be biased in favour of developed nations which connects the world in similarities within the media.[14]On the Internet, physical distance is even less of a hindrance to the real-time communicative activities of people. Social Spheres are greatly expanded by the openness of the web and the ease at which people can search for online communities and interact with others who share the same interests and concerns. According to Maria Ozawa and Shigeo Tokuda, the enhanced \"electric speed in bringing all social and political functions together in a sudden implosion has heightened human awareness of responsibility to an intense degree.\"[15] Increased speed of communication and the ability for people to read about, spread, and react to global news quickly, enables individuals to become more involved with others from various social groups and countries around the world and to be more aware of our global responsibilities.[15] Similarly, web-connected computers enable people to link their web sites together."
